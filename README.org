* About
AntiSocialNetwork is a simple social network project.
Named as such due to being populated with fake people, posts, comments and such.
It was originally a database project, with presentation available in [[docs/AntiSocialNetwork.pdf]]
Details about SQL files are available in the comments of [[./create_database.sh]]

* Installation instructions
Requires installed python 3 (made under version 3.9) and working PostgreSQL.
Scripts were written with /zsh/, but they should work with /bash/, possibly with a /bash/ command before them.  

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/ugandalf/AntiSocialNetwork.git
cd AntiSocialNetwork
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./create_database.sh
